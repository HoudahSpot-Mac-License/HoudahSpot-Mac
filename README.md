## Overview

<a href="#">HoudahSpot for macOS</a> is aimed at people who have outgrown simple search bars and need real control over how they locate files. It sits on top of Spotlight’s index but exposes the underlying power through a flexible query builder. You can combine criteria such as name, kind, path, tags, dates and content to narrow results with surgical precision. For users with years of documents spread across disks and synced folders, this ability to describe exactly what you are looking for changes how you think about search.

The results interface is designed for investigation rather than quick one-off lookups. Columns, filters and <a href="#">saved searches</a> make it easier to refine queries iteratively until only the right items remain. You can save frequently used searches as templates for future runs, turning complex criteria into single-click tools. Previews and metadata panes reduce the need to open each file, and the ability to search within specific folders or volumes helps keep work and archives separate when necessary.

On macOS, HoudahSpot behaves like a specialised research instrument that complements Finder. It works well in tandem with note apps, development tools and design software, helping you rediscover assets exactly when you need them. Over time, it becomes the go-to place for serious file hunting, turning “I know I had that somewhere” into a solvable problem instead of a dead end.
